# What do you think is Cardano's developer ecosystem's most painful point?

## Onboarding (44)

- Lack of documentation, one cannot figure out how to use cardano's original tools.
- Lack of easy tutorials
- Steep learning curve
- High learning curve
- It is much easier to get started with Ethereum/Solana/Cosmos/Algorand.
- Installation
- guides, tutorials, documentation
- Amount of information to absorbe and clear blockchain interoperability path
- Training, and access to learning information.
- Lack of tutorials
- Not painful but need more time for learn new tech
- Complexity
- Elitism and high entry barriers.
- Lack of a structured learning program.
- Finishing PPP in order to write useful code.
- Painful to get started and use.
- Developer education and onboarding
- Very hard to get started. Learning curve is steep,  Initial, Build time for Plutus projects is high, and once you understand Plutus, interfacing it with main/test net is tough
- The ramp up to be productive is very steep.
- Ease of use has to be considered, requiring developers to run a full cardano node for everything is not optimal.
- Many components required to setup Plutus smart contracts.
- The learning curve is steep, but this can be overcome with a passionate developer.
- Good courses (6+ months for a course, to learn basics, is ridiculous)
- Entry barrier
- Lack of documentation for new developers, non PhDs
- Onboarding
- Lack of understanding how to setup development environment and how to use all the CLIs, tools, and services
- Training/teaching material is lacking.
- There could be better training materials.
- Absolute lack of onboarding.
- Lack of simple exemples and baby steps tutorials
- Lack of documentation and/or tutorials in most tools. Video tutorials would also be very helpful to beginner developers.
- Lack of easy to use documentation
- Lack of good documentation and guides for beginners. Everything is at a too high level
- developer onboarding
- The ability to build your first development stack. It is still quite difficult to perform the initial steps necessary
- Documentation / pedagogy
- steep learning curve to understand what tools are needed to get started
- Serialization libraries, only few languages are supported and of these, the documentation is aweful.
- The learning curve is quite steep. The time from interest to first deployment is quite long.
- Lack of documentation. Its crucial this be fixed for better on boarding
- A way to bootstrap new applications quickly (regardless of if they are on-chain or off-chain). Think along the lines of npx create-react-app my-app" but with a template/skeleton for a web-based wallet app for example"
- high learning curve
- The Plutus Pioneer Program

## Haskell / Plutus (32)

- Use of haskell
- Haskell
- Haskell
- The adoption of Haskell throughout the market compared to other programming languages.
- Cardano packages written in Haskell needs a good way to be used by Javascript and Browser.
- The language chosen for constructing smart contracts, making the barrier to entry painful even for experienced programmers.
- Haskell
- Functional Programming
- Difficult plutus, haskell and functional programming
- Steep learning curve for Haskell.
- Haskell
- Functional program smart contract
- Learning Haskell
- Functional programming language paradigm and some Plutus parts that are necessary but hard to understand like template Haskell.
- Haskell.
- Plutus
- Plutus documentation
- Plutus
- Haskell, Plutus
- There also seems to be ominous talks for Plutus compilers for imperative languages.
- Plutus
- Haskell
- Not supporting Rust or Go for SC development.  Haskell/Plutus is fine but Rust support would make the ecosystem of dapps blow up IMO
- I'm waiting for c# development
- Haskell is a big step when coming from non functional languages.
- Learning Haskell/plutus
- Lack of knowledge on functional programming language. Plutus architechture is complex.
- haskell
- Haskell / Plutus dedicated developers.
- Haskell
- Everyone can read rust as it's similar  to C-like languages. But every time I see Haskell I give up.
- Plutus contract development and deployment

## Unreliable & cumbersome development of key components (30)

- PAB's development is too slow
- IOG funding is optimized for marketing and controlled by business people. CF and Emurgo don't seem to be releasing funds at anything close to an appropriate rate.
- Slow process
- Inconsistent
- Software updates aren't always reliable at first; but they eventually excel!
- Rapid Software Change, however understandable.
- IOG's (lack of) organization
- Too many moving parts and esoteric dependencies
- In light of my struggles in seamlessly updating to node 1.35.0 I would say that was a pain point. I ended up having to remove all traces of the node to get it to update successfully.
- JIRA
- IOHKs Ivory tower position which is just to far away from the eco systems needs.
- ugly, unfriendly, poorly documented, obtuse code
- As a Nix/Cabal newbie it was hard to create new projects and manage dependencies/versions. I don't know the current state but at the time a quick guide would have been very helpful.
- Extremely frustrating. I see great progress in Catalyst, in marketing, in Stake Pool Operations but on developers things are very very very slow. I left Ethereum in 2021 and joined Cardano with my WIMS community and membership and activity has declined extremely because at Cardano things are very slow. The Alonzo delayed and now the Vasil is still not running and plutus v2 hinges on Vasil upgrade.
- Neither IOG or Emurgo's light wallets are usable on par with Nami. If you want developers to build on your platform you need to bootstrap key components yourself.
- Nix
- DB Sync
- Getting a development environment working with Nix.
- Lacking support from IO, CF, Emurgo. Version 1 of Plutus was also a bad joke. Node.js 0.12 was closer to a version 1.
- It tends to seem rigid. Especially with the wallet system development centred around yoroi
- It's a marathon. Keep building. Installers like Daedalus with cardano-cli, and Marlowe Run/Play, Lace, etc are the right types of higher level tools to bring in web developers.
- The use of Nix combined with a source distribution.
- Quality assurance and leadership compatible with decentralized governance
- Too Slow
- Release engineering really needs to be improved so it is easier to update projects that have dependencies on IOG / Cardano items
- A lot of changes with Plutus V2, but we have to discover them by ourself and I am not sure where to find all of the new info
- I personally have a hard time understanding IOG repos. Would be nice to see how someone contributes to the node.
- QA of upstream components. The community always finds a ton of bugs after IOG has tagged releases. Simple stuff like running each cardano-cli command and verifying its output would have caught them.
- db-sync.....
- PAB

## Lack of development tools / libraries (30)

#### Misc (20)

- Not enough tools
- Lack of tooling (especially if you don't run a node locally and want to write off-chain code in Haskell, not JS).
- Lack of Developer Tooling
- While Haskell is a great language, the tools of Haskell especially the ones made by IOG sucks.
- Lack of friendly tools.
- Tools
- Tooling, smart contract evaluation.
- Incomplete tools; deficient of developer support; key functionality unsupported, obscured or missing.
- Tooling
- Tooling & infrastructure
- Tooling for development is still very fragmented
- Creating more libraries and tools
- Streamlined developer experience
- Lack of standardized/trusted tooling
- The lack of a standard for fullstack solutions
- Lack of utilities for frontend languages, e.g. React libraries for serialization (That's not written in rust)
- The lack of modern language tooling, like TypeScript libraries.
- lack of hosted publicly available APIs that can be (efficiently) used for wallets, blockfrost looks promising but support for bulk requests is something that prevents us from using it in production
- Libraries
- Tooling

#### IDE (6)

- Missing full-life-cycle IDE.
- Haskell tooling (IDE integration).
- Toolchain and libraries/frameworks; Extremely difficult to open a text editor and work on a project end-to-end
- Developer UX and tooling is a far cry from industry standards
- IDE setup
- Ease of use, user friendlyness of the tooling, for example IDE has no autocomplete.

#### Smart-contracts Development (4)

- Lack of smart contract libraries
- No proper library to develop smart contracts without downloading binary and compiling.
- Though Plutus is great, but the tools around Plutus are still not ideal. For any new dev,  setting up the dev environment to successfully deploy the first contract is still a painful process.
- Back in Jan it was very hard to create plutus txs in a web-app. Serialisation-lib didn't support them and one couldn't calc tx fees. From answers on their forum, their dev didn't even seem to know about Plutus Scripts.


## Poorly organized / hard to find resources (27)

- I Miss Learning Ressources
- Lack of organization of resources that are already available.
- Lack of documentation
- Lack of UBER documentation - that means how to combine all these libraries and frameworks that people write, e.g. Lucid, Cardano-Lib, Cardano Transaction Library from MLabs to write dApps and also off chain code, e.g. Scrolls and Oura.
- Lack of documentation
- Lack of common modularization
- Documentation/guides are scattered and generally hard to find.
- The documentation for different libraries and components is lacking and very disjointed. Sometimes it is not clear where to look for specific technical information.
- Segmentation of state
- No central source from where you get the information
- Not many diagrams/ visualisations how things intimately hang together
- lack of developer tooling, lack of documentation on Plutus.
- The docs are all over the place. They also assume too much of people's prior knowledge.
- Fragmented tooling
- Finding all the wonderful tools out there was complicated and time consuming. It is getting much better every day.
- Documentation Fragmentation.
- Structured documentation.
- Lack of documentation, Lack of Roadmap, Lack of good courses
- Lack of usable documentation.
- Developers are not regularly pointed toward the tools with the least friction in official communication channel(s).
- The documentation is scattered.
- Ecosystem fragmentation
- Jungle of libraries
- The noise. Until you find the niche where you sit, it's complicated to navigate. That is the spirit of Discord
- It is sometimes hard to know where to look and where to find information. Important details are scattered across many pieces, and sometimes buried in code repositories so one has to put an archeologist's hat to find information it needs. Once you know where to look, the information is quite abundant.
- Lack of documentation
- Not enough documentation or standards.

## Lack of maturity (14)

- Being first to invent a given reference implementation roundtrip while absorbing all upfront costs and risks.
- Hydra needs to mature in order to increase utility.
- We are early.
- Fragmentation... too many tools with different levels of maturity.
- It is not yet complete. It consumes a lot of time to keep up with changes
- changeability as the system is still young
- Unfinished product with limited utility while other blockchains it competes with have more development and usage; though Cardano boasts years of research and marketing, it is still in an early stage of development and much of its current value may be based on its potential.
- Developer experience is awful. It looks like pet project rather than professional project.
- That there are still few developers.
- Lack of mature, integrated developer tooling with top notch documentation. There are a lot of solutions but not yet mature. This will happen over time.
- Tooling is inconsistent, broken or non-existent, libraries are not mature.
- Still evolving capabilities and basic tooling. PAB not mature enough yet and mobile tech
- Early state of the infrastructure
- It is still too much pioneer

## Outdated, innacurate or incomplete documentation (12)

- The guides and videos are not in sync and out of date which makes it difficult to learn. You watch a video and the next one isn't in line or references past information then it takes an extra effort to bridge the gap in information. Basically we need better education opportunties.
- Documentation/guides are out-of-date.
- Lack of standardised tools and updated documentation that can help a highly motivated developer to start developing on Cardano.  There are tools and documentation but they are mostly obsolete or just not working
- The docs are horrible and are not updated often enough.
- Keeping documentation up to date especially with new tech like Plutus.
- Documentation is often behind and limited in comparison to what is expected of the developper.
- Perhaps lack of documentation or place to delve deeper into how nodes work
- The documentation is incomplete or obsolete
- Developer documents are not up to date or are completely missing
- Cardano really lacks extensive documentation and I often end up looking at source code of various projects. So... Docs about core mechanisms would be really appreciated (explaining UTXO, PoS algo, tx structure, staking pools, rewards distribution). Basically Mastering Cardano book.
- Documentations could be better
- The sometimes outdated or abandoned documentation for the various tools

## Lack of real-world examples (11)

- Not enough open source examples.
- The documentation is poor and there isn't a good selection of best practices.
- The lack of best practices
- Comprehension towards implementation within the rails
- No central repo like OpenZepplin for audited code and design patterns.
- Documentation and examples, especially for Plutus.
- You only focus on writing smart contracts in Plutus/Haskell but don't show how to use it from application level. Provide real application example that I can run in my browser and use my wallet.
- More practical user case and infra and monitoring
- Lack of examples
- Documentation, Examples
- No official up-to-date best practice / full stack onboarding

## Lack of accessibility (10)

- Traduzione solo in inglese
- Its mostly in English
- Lack of information in various languages.
- Accessibility
- Lack of mobile support
- Lack of documentation in different operating system e.g. mac
- Everything is in unix or other academic based systems. Most business application developers are in C# or F#. A mirror set of code and libraries for Microsoft based developers would increase exposure to devs and business integration adoption.
- The tools need more accessibility.
- Mobile applications, UI/UX development.
- There is no resource in other languages

## Difficulty to obtain funding (8)

- Existing funding mechanisms are high friction or time-consuming. Becoming influential (and likable) on twitter to win Catalyst funds does not require the same skillset or focus as shipping real products with a novel stack.
- Lack of being funded
- Catalyst is shattered system allowing already powerful player to hold others down
- Promoting sustainable development ecosystem, in parallel with gradually leading the application of dapps into daily life.
- The price
- Price fluctuations push development away
- Price rate
- Price

## Hype / Disconnection between reality and marketing (7)

- The consumers that pump and dump
- Community hype and pumping that does not match on-the-ground technical realities or a large enough pool of experienced developers that are qualified to deliver on the vision.
- People need to understand to be patient and let things grow, not understanding that due to market pressure will cause harm
- Communities expect quick good results.
- The expectation that everything has to be for free / open source or very cheap.
- ADA may be “overvalued” compared to other smart contract blockchains.
- Overpromising

## (Too) High resource / hardware requirements (6)

- resource usage
- cardano-graphql consumes too much hardware resource, which harms decentralization a lot.
- In 3rd world countries, internet access is expensive. People pay by the MB to download content. However, most of the Daps designed to “bank the unbanked” don’t take this into account. Cardano developers need to be more aware of their target market and, specifically, their access point to your dapp. I know first hand that a lot of these people disable JavaScript and / or images in their phone browsers to minimise the cost of using the internet. Does your dapp still work under these constraints?
- The lack of a standard for fullstack solutions
- You need to simplify cost access, for example a instance for db-sync will cost around 300-400$ and it'll be instable, providing api for service. There is individual initiative like dandelion but it needs to be really backed by cardano
- Setup a pool, you need to have a lot of money

## Not Enough Community Support (4)

- Hostile/toxic/jealous community members that overpower the majority of people that are supportive.
- Lack of support from the Cardano Community to help support projects.
- It needs even more cooperation between progamers and ordinary people who want to become someone in the Cardano ecosystem.
- The community

## Hard to troubleshoot issues (4)

- Troubleshooting is horribly painful and time consuming.
- Coding, solving issues
- Libraries no clear way to do things. Difficult to solve the issues encountered.
- Some of the people I know in that community have questions for more than 2 months that are still not answered from IOG and the development team.

## Lack of identity system (3)

- Would love to be using Atala Prism but there is no access or documentation.
- Lack of an identity system developed by IOG or another developer.
- The Atala-prism delays are also affecting many projects.

## Lack of Hackathons / Meetups (3)

- Lack of Hackathons with Financial Incentives
- Lack of casual chatter, discussions, and community about Plutus on social media (Twitter). Also lack of hackathons.
- Where to talk with the community ?

## Market Perception (2)

- Market perception, lack of coolness amongst non cardano developers.
- Getting people to understand why Cardano is the best ecosystem to onboard as developpers, and getting to know where to start from

## Unclassified / Off-Topic

- Lack of patience
- DOCUMENTATION. Terrible.
- transaction building, and mem and cpu limitations
- We’re on the edge of what’s possible with Haskell… And building JavaScript in a principled way sucks.
- Those 1000+ protocols totally build by 3rd party.
- Deep tech stack
- Too much to do and so many distractions makes focus essential and stressful.
- Lack of DAO tooling. Embarrassing way The DCF has gone silent.
- Stagnation
- My class foto pioneere2 was messed up by disinterest and incompetence. Which makes me angry because its not a rocket science to make it happen and give appreciation to pinoners but IOHK failed. What makes me uneasy is when IOHK fails on such easy tasks on what else IOHK fails to bring Cardano forward?
