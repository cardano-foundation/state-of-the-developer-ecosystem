# If you had to name ONE, what tool/library/feature would you rather have right now to ease your developer experience on Cardano?

## Complete SDKs in various languages (Python, JavaScript, C#, Rust...) (25)

- single sdk
- cardano-python
- CF supported, fully-featured pycardano
- Typescript or Rust support
- FORTRAN
- Simple smart contract dev & deploy in .NET
- C# or java language
- Fully features Java APIs
- cardano-js
- An Open source CLI written in C# or F#.
- Script analyzer/optimizer.
- Golang Serialization lib (full-featured)
- A single tool suite that encompasses creating a project, language server, testing and deploying. Think xcode for iPhone
- Rust
- More JavaScript tools and libs.
- Python
- a complete Rust SDK for off-chain / on-chain development without 3rd party services.
- better python tools
- C#
- Pure JS implementation of serialisation lib
- A natively built JavaScript library for deserialization.
- Better CTL, for example with tracer support, better purescript bridge, etc.
- cardano-serialization-lib equivalent for Haskell, if not a full-fledged PAB
- Libraries for building transaction in various languages. Something like cardano-serialization-lib for other languages, officially supported and always updated. Same for coin selection algos.
- More serialization libs for more languages like C# to use in blazor wasm with ease

## IDE & easier setup of development environments (18)

- plutus/emacs integration
- A good VSCode plugin for language integration.
- A visual studio plugin Cardano companion
- IDE
- Replit + Plutus 
- vs code plugin
- An IDE akin to Daedalus with a bundled local testnet, cli tools, Marlowe, etc. A full Cardano IDE.
- full VSCode integrated Plutus docs (types, completion, checks)
- code autocomplete IDE
- Visual Studio Integration
- Good IDE support, similar dev frameworks like Truffle suite, Hardhat
- Build-system which is not confusing
- Easy mainnet deployment tool. With Ethereum, from Remix we deployed quickly to mainnet. From the plutus playground let us easily deploy smart contracts and CNFT  to mainnet
- A downloadable VM with all needed tools pre-installed
- NixOS package for all of IOHK's libraries and/or a VM that I can run with the whole dev environment working inside.
- tool / library for setting up custom devnets for testing
- Starting development in an easier way and not having to build from nix shell
- Something like the truffle suite on Ethereum

## More alternatives compiling to Plutus-Core (17)

- plutus contracts in typescript, js/ts is how web apps are built, you can't get around that
- Bridge to various languages
- Language similar to Marlowe, Mukn: Glow / TxPipe: Aiken
- drag and drop Plutus
- A lite version of Plutus that abstracts away most of the intensity and let’s the developer focus on the logic of the contract.
- IELE - specially supporting C#
- Rust to UPLC compiler to write Smart Contracts using Rust
- Dart
- Python for smart contracts
- Rust support
- Being able to write contracts in Python
- Tools for writing Plutus Scripts in an imperative language.
- Ability to write plutus validators in any programming language and compile to plutus core
- A tool that would allow me to write JS code that compiles to Plutus Core
- dedicated smart contract language
- EVMs
- The ability to write a plutus smart contract in Kotlin.

## More tools around DApp ↔ Wallets integrations (16)

- Simpler and more rich CIP30 standard or something similar
- Web3 toolkit
- wallet integration
- Clean website/wallet integration library.
- Better ADAhandle integration.
- Web3 connector for javascript
- Dapp wallet connector
- cardano wallet library like web3 (API connection, address management, ...)
- Cross-platform smart wallet that integrates with web dApplications well.
- lace
- a single wallet focused SDK (at least browser) with full support for all Cardano functionality
- Easily consumable / predictable light wallet for DApps
- JavaScript wallet connector
- A Client side wallet library for web3 sites
- Cip30,Only the Name wallet is working good,elses are suck.
- Typescript smart contract integration and ability to integrate mobile app development with Cardano stack seamlessly

## A curated list of real-world / end-to-end examples (13)

- regularly updated FAQs with examples built by skilled Haskell devs for starting out programmers
- examples
- Real-world reference implementations
- prefabricated codes
- Diverse Plutus code templates
- Examples of useful sample real world projects.
- One on one project mentorship when learning Haskell. Emurgo could ask previous developers to guide current developers as community service. I definitely would help others after the struggles I've had.
- python smart contract full stack deployment example
- Open sourced example code for key bloclchain infrastructure
- library of example validators
- Better documentation, with real use cases as examples. Library for SmartContract Templates and Design Patterns
- Design patterns
- Smart contracts samples and how to deploy them

## A Plutus application backend, or equivalent (12)

- fast and affordable PAB production environment
- Decent PAB
- A non-bloated PAB 
- In browser PAB
- A working, ergonomic, efficient PAB.
- A 100% working PAB
- PAB
- Also a robust PAB
- PAB
- PAB
- PAB
- Have Plutus only for Onchain, and don't use it for Offchain. Everyone is already comfortable writing backend services and front end apps with javascript, having offchain Plutus just complicates things

## Better access to Blockchain data (9)

- A better API to access blockchain information (and more standardised)
- The Graph
- A tool/library that allows to subscribe, collect, and provide UTXO data for specific script addresses (similar to cardano-wallet but for script addresses).
- some JSON RPC over the cardano-node like ethereum
- socket functionality to broadcast when transactions are completed
- Being able to hook a client application into ledger events via a dedicated node-to-client mini-protocol,
- An easy and fast way to access the ledger data in a relational DB that I can host myself (cardano-db-sync takes more than 12 hours to synchronize, even when using a snapshot). Carp, Koios and adjacent solutions are either not self-deployable or the deployment/installation is not documented well enough at this point.
- blockchain explorer
- Open Source Blockfrost

## Marlowe (5)

- Marlowe
- Marlowe
- Marlowe
- Marlow
- Marlowe

## Client-side evaluation of script execution units (3)

- A library can evaluate Plutus fee on Browsers.
- easier plutus smart contract evaluation of exunits
- evaluating smart contracts on client side

## Optimizations of Plutus-Core (3)

- Not needing to pay for type-safety in PlutusTx (converting script contexts is expensive).
- Have custom datatypes work as fast as builtin types for Plutus.
- Script analyzer/optimizer.
