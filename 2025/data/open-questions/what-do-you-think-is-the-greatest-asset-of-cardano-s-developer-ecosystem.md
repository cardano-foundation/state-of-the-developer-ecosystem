# What do you think is the greatest asset of Cardano’s developer ecosystem?

- Backend and Infra
- Security, scalability and reliability
- persistence of core developers and other builders
- A book, eUTxO Design Patterns with Aiken- Making eUTxO easier to program with, especially some fancy things proposed by Phil DiSarrio since some patterns we have are really anti-patterns or lack of expressiveness of Plutus- ecosystem wide support for programmable assets (CIP-113/CIP-143)
- Aiken
- Open source contributions and great community talent.
- The community.
- helping each other out
- Ogmios by far due to it's generic protocol abstraction and language decoupling.
- There is a lot of talent in the ecosystem.
- Security
- Transaction determinism
- The people that are dedicated to improve the ecosystem constantly and work on many projects and venues to achieve that
- Technical rigor and open discourse
- Abundant
- Community help from members
- Strong developer community. We could ask and get help from other senior builder.
- dedicated builders
- Willingness to collaborate
- Open source principles
- I'm particularly happy about Aiken: the language is well documented, easy to learn and deploy. Testing is painful though with preparing the tx context alway being time consuming and error prone. An easy way to come up with fixtures or fluit builders would expedite things quite a bit
- Staking. And the entire stack is rock solid.
- The eUTXO model is probably its most significant technical asset. Developers who take the time to understand it often find it enables more predictable and secure smart contract behavior, which is crucial for financial applications where bugs can be catastrophic.
- Variety
- Txpipe, Anastasia, and other infra builders like them.
- Strong Community and Treasury-Funded Ecosystem
- Aiken getting started and utxi crash course
- Demeter makes it really easy for new comers to get setup quickly. Reminds me of FreeCodeCamp. Andamio has really good tutorials on how things work. The Cardano foundation also has good resources for new comers.
- Highly intelligent and passionate.
- IOG
- Aiken
- Competent engineers
- TxPipe, MeshJS, and Aiken
- The reliability of the chain and The developers willing to build on it
- The growing diversity of programming languages that can natively interact with the chain. The more we add, the more developers we get. There will always be a \preferred\ development environment within any ecosystem, but the long tail brings more exposure and new devs.
- Lucas
- TxPipe Discord
- Aiken
- Collective sense of passion
- Resiliency and core beliefs of developers.
- The people.
- It seems like a great extension to Bitcoin
- Evolution
- Their stability and descentralization
- Constructive and helpful to each other
- Decentralization always being at the center of discussions and Cardano Native Assets as first class citizens.
- Its plurality, with many communities and complementary efforts. There are libraries in almost every language, and people building tools at every levels.
- Functional programming with strong types
- our patient ability to keep taking small steps in the face of uncertainty
- Catalyst
