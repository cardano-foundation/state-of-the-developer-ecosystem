# Do you have any idea on how to improve the next potential Cardano Buidler Fest?

- I like more focus on core infrastructure debates, discussions, and showcases. Much of what I saw was people showing off products.
- An overview of the attendees with descriptions of their work Like a short CV to easily identify common interests.
- Make it 3 days? Maybe plan more time for people just to talk/share ideas/insights without booking dedicated sessions. Like, longer breaks or something idk.
- It's pretty good as it is I'd say, but I am not objective.
- Keep them happening every year, keep them at 100 participants, keep the code challenge to attend.
- focus on paint point of cardano
- Better workshop
- A 3rd day of only hacking. No talks, just developers leaving the dream.
- Keep doing. Decide whether or not to commit to open spaces with high fidelity, or remove it from the agenda
