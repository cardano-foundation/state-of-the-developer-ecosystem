# It would be nice if there were a CLI for … ?

- end-to-end dapp development which combines python ecosystem with aiken and hydra-based solutions
- currently no wishes
- Simple voting for DReps
- Integrated cross-chain bridge operationns. Currently, moving assets between Cardano and other blockchains requires using various web interfaces and third-party services. If the CLI could handle wrapped asset operations, initiate cross-chain swaps, or interact with bridge protocols directly from the command line, it would make multi-chain operations much more scriptable and automatable. Also, AI-assisted transaction building and analysis would be cutting edge. Imagine describing what you want to do in natural language and having the CLI suggest the optimal transaction structure, estimate fees across different scenarios, or warn you about potential issues before you submit. It could analyze your transaction patterns and suggest optimizations or security improvements based on best practices.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​
- In-depth transaction analysis and review
- building transaction and managing some state (tx3 is not complete, I liked cardaminal but it's not maintained)
- slot battle diagnostics
- Natively converting bech32 ed25519_sk1 key to jsoh skey format. Ideally in Cardano-address
- CBOR manipulation and pretty-printing; like jq, but for CBOR
- Debug CBOR với smart contract bằng Aiken
- token registry
