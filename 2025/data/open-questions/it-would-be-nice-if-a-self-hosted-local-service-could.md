- sync quickly and be stable

- be easy to install and use

- provide an end-to-end developer experience

- Be easy to use on custom networks and local devnet

- light/mithril node with power-user level wallet, with Tx-cart built in, directly interfacing with Fallen-Icarus' P2P-DeFi Kernel

- Cardano node + indexer on coolify

- Provide proofs of all served data

- Serve as a performant lightweight indexer

- Automatically alert on lost slot battles with diagnostics to help improve BP node performance.

- Support dry-running transactions (validating without submitting)

- Kuber IDE could be free and flexible forever

- spin up private network
