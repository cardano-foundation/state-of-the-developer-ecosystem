# What do you think is the biggest pain point of Cardano's developer ecosystem?

- Understanding what systems are best for your application, UX is fairly poor on most websites
- Learning curve and cost of certification
- Poor support of Apple silicon for development environment, like as in cardano-transactions 'stack install': Error: [S-9443] No setup information found for ghc-8.6.5 on your platform. This probably means a GHC binary distribution has not yet been added for OS key macosx-aarch64. Supported versions: ghc-8.10.5, ...
- complete lack of web/mobile/desktop/tv reference implementation of a simple \single sign on\ with simple sign transaction/message easily replicated in any language/platform
-     eUTxO is harder than accounts and it needs good books for patterns- make global state handling for smart contracts as easy as possible + books + video and documentation of it (it is not obvious)
- Not everyone knows Haskell.
- Batchers
- Lack of plug and play libraries that are also compatible with LLMs for vibe coding prototypes and bring down the entry barrier to Cardano.
- Indexing databases.
- reinventing the wheel over and over again
- Transaction building across multiple programming languages, and having open sourced tooling for each that is well supported and maintained.
- Token holders.
- Lack of working easy to follow examples and documentation
- VC Hesistance / Fear
- The lack of a canonical cbor encoding and stable libraries
- Elitism
- Lack of integration
- Lack of tooling and complete documentation Lots assume you already know everything on Cardano
- Lack of up-to-date documentation and workshop.
- dev learning curve
- Lack of quality documentation
- Web off-chain libraries. Fragmented, poorly documented, often incomplete.
- Smart Contract dev experience not on the same level as EVM. Not by a longshot.
- Documentation is sometimes scattered across different sources, libraries may have inconsistent maintenance, and there isn’t always a clear “blessed path” for common tasks. Developers coming from web2 or other ecosystems often find themselves needing to piece together workflows from multiple tools and sources rather than having a cohesive, well-integrated development environment.The learning curve is also steep, which compounds the tooling issues. The eUTXO model requires a different mental model than account-based systems, Plutus requires understanding functional programming concepts, and there aren’t as many tutorials, courses, or Stack Overflow answers to fall back on when you get stuck. This means developers spend more time figuring out how to do things rather than actually building, which can be frustrating and slow down adoption.The smaller ecosystem size creates a chicken-and-egg problem too. Fewer developers means fewer libraries, frameworks, and third-party tools, which means it’s harder to build quickly, which discourages more developers from joining. While the community is passionate and helpful, you can’t always find someone who’s solved your exact problem before, whereas in larger ecosystems someone has almost certainly hit the same issue and documented the solution.Infrastructure tooling like testing frameworks, local development environments, and debugging tools also lag behind more mature chains. Getting a smooth local development workflow set up can be more involved than it should be.
- Chaos
- a broad based lack of vision for the need to build DeFi in layers, with \core P2P primitives\ at the L1, and specialization offloaded to L2s. We as an ecosystem need to elevate fallen-icarus and his ideas.
- Tooling Maturity and Developer Experience
- ComplexityNo good - no code platform like marlowe
- The fact that you have to have twitter to see the latest news sucks. I have to to open up that toxic waste land to see what's going on with the eco-system.
- Not enough devs. Poor cross-over with other developer ecosystems.
- Poor documentation or records
- Complexity to write DApps, fragmented and immature libs
- Lack of good tx lib
- Breaking changes
- APIs and accessing chain-data lack of governance CIPs
- The learning curve and complexity of the the system
- Going from zero to working DApp, no matter what environment you build in, is non-trivial for new developers.
- Smart contract debugging, smart contract testing, smart contract verification
- Incentives for OSS developers to keep libraries recent.
- Plutus v3 in combination with meshSDK.Had some problems with transaction building. Better Docs are needed for a pleb like me.
- Understanding underlying architecture
- Fragmented documentation
- Developer experience. More funding needed for projects like TxPipe.Company funding - larger funding mechanisms (beyond Catalyst) for emerging and proven startups.
- batcher, composability
- Onboarding tools for new developers. they don't know what to use and if is possible to use tech stack different from Haskell.
- lack of clear documentation
- Official documentation and setup.
- Integration & acceptance of with other blockchains, stable coin liquidity, perhaps even competitive throughput (though we currently don't even use the chain's available block space)
- Offchain/Onchain integration
- More friendly dev experience and abstractions of common use cases
- Necessity to deal with UTXO model every time.
- Duplication of effort and unawareness of others' work
- Immature eUTXO-native solutions/abstractions.
- Finding what's actually available, all on one page, with simple filter clicking. Has anyone collected all the Finished Catalyst proposals (software libs) anywhere?
- Its immaturity. Despite several years of existence and a $30B market capitalization, most libraries across all languages are in their infancy, partially complete, not well tested and sometimes even just abandoned.
- Debug Smart Contract
- Lack of simplicity and speed. Specifically nix and cabal/Haskell are slow together
- we're amazed by Cardano from a technical perspective, but we're unsure of its place in the world. this makes it hard to know how to balance building for a market and building for r&d purposes
- nerds
