# It would be nice if a service provided...

## ...additional analytics & content delivery API (assets metadata, raw transactions, stake distribution snapshots, handle resolution, CDNs...). [13]

- "The Graph for Cardano or a universal modular GraphQL API without much dependencies, performant, and with time-based queries like Logosphere project."
- "A reliable, up-to-date Token Data API - decimals/logo. Some fragmentation exists; not all tokens are on the Token Registry."
- "Availability of transaction CBORs in Cexplorer and/or Cardanoscan would be quite nice."
- "Higher level on-chain insights, but don't worry I'm working on that myself ;)"
- "It would be nice if a service could provide general smart contract indexing so we don't have to rebuild that indexing logic over and over again—for example, one could need SundaeSwap price data or jpg price data indexing out of the box."
- "Stake snapshots as an API"
- "NFTs cdn"
- "ADA Handle resolution"
- "A Cardano-based alternative to IPFS"
- "Better querying directly from the cardano node"
- "Slotting arithmetic"
- "[...] I would like to get fees collected in block payload."
- "I'd like a decentralised dbu"
- "Accounting related exports for onchain transactions. Point of sale capabilities for merchants",
- "Past epoch stake snapshots [...]"
- "It would be nice if a service provided access to the blockchain with customizable indices for querying. I think there might be services that do this already, which reminds me that it would be great to have a C# library that allows us to walk the blockchain and monitor its tail, like txpipe/oura.",
- "Different configuration for dbsync, especially one that make use of the \"tx_out\": {     \"value\": \"consumed\" }",

## ...more transaction handling and construction specific features (e.g. dry submission, better rejection feedback, UTxO management, higher-level abstractions). [12]

- "a way to single-step through smart contract transactions or at least give a clear reason why it fails"
- "An easier way to transact around UTXOs"
- "dry transaction submission / phase-1 transaction validations."
- "Something similar to eth smart contracts, a way to generically interact with dapps that doesn't require specific knowledge of how to construct transactions"
- "Utxo management for tx builders more easily to allow tx chaining"
- "Accounting-related exports for onchain transactions. Point of sale capabilities for merchants"
- "Json schema to make code generation for data handling easier."
- "Dapp interface transaction library"
- "Tx introspection"
- "A more visual way to see a deployed smart contract e.g., state, properties, usage.",
- "I guess the biggest one I've met in the last period was a good (missing) transaction building (with smart contracts) service."
- "Automatically parse and generate front end connectivity to my smart contract"

## ...better documentation and up-to-date examples of usage and deployment. [12]

- "Good documentation"
- "More examples"
- "Documentation"
- "generically the most important thing a service can provide me with is (up to date) examples of using it so when I first set it up I can quickly start using it"
- "more Education"
- "Sample of code to use those services"
- "Higher level usage (good abstractions) and good documentation."
- "Oura, better docs"
- "[...]Documentation, video tutorials and patterns Cardano needs a DevRel that can spend whole day only teaching about Cardano in various languages and SDKs, not just Aiken but also OpShim, Plu-ts, Java Cardano Client Lib, Blaze, Lucid-Evolution, Yaci-Store, Carp, eUTxO Design Patterns trainings!"
- "Deployment examples kubernetes, ecs, docker, whatever but my god is it a mess to deploy in Cardano"
- "A differents ways to help you and make you understand the action your are about to use."
- "More real word examples and tutorials for smart contracts."

## ...nothing extra, they're good as they are. [12]

- "Currently I have everything I need from services. So it's clear that there's possible improvement for every service, but I get everything done I want to do.",
- "I'm content",
- "dolos is perfect",
- "They're all good this way",
- "I don't think anything is missing",
- "I think services are in a good place right now",
- "Nothing not already existing or planned comes to mind at the moment.",
- "Again generally pretty happy",
- "Can't think of any right now",
- "No comment at the moment",
- "Current available services already provide all you need to build dApps, [...], but the ecosystem seems to be improving rapidly recently in that regard"
- "Adder is fantastic [...]"

## ...easier deployment setup and overall lower barrier to entry. [9]

- "Easier getting started template [...]"
- "It would be nice to easily understand which version of what is used by Cardano node. The complexity of the Haskell/Nix setup is insane."
- "if marlowe would open up on explaining how to run all the infrastructure components for the runtime API"
- "Better setup of local or remote nodes for fast dev"
- "Infrastructure to wrap L1 services (eg Ogmios, indexers) so that SPOs could easily host these and there were incentive mechanisms for them to do so. Fair and transparent incentive mechanisms such as pay-per-use."
- "Blockfrost for free"
- "SDK for services like Ogmios etc.... Instead of APIs"
- "[...], maybe we need better dev ex, [...]"
- "...a db-sync compatible API."

## ...trustless & decentralized data-availability solutions (e.g. through zero-knowledge state proofs). [7]

- "Identity, DA for L2s in Cardano, decentralization of storage and cloud computing for dapps."
- "It would be nice if a service provided Zero Knowledge Proof"
- "Zero Knowledge Proof"
- "Generate succinct proofs of Cardano state transitions."
- "Decentralised oracle"
- "Zero Knowledge"
- "ZK Tooling"

## ...event streaming solutions. [6]

- "A simple and automated way to subscribe to notifications for a particular address or type of transaction"
- "Lightweight event stream processing of transactions"
- "for cross-platform implementation and live streaming implementation"
- "Automated way to subscribe to notifications for a particular address or type of transaction"
- "Purpose-built node that follows n dynamically defined contracts"
- "Customized push notifications to a mobile app"

## ...smaller hardware requirements or better performances overall (in particular cardano-db-sync).  [4]

- "careano db sync too slow",
- "[...] without the large RAM/Storage resource requirements of db-sync + postgresql. For example, kupo being extended to provide details from prior snapshots."
- "security+speed",
- "[...] without heavy hardware requirement"

## ...custom testing capabilities (private testnets, rollback simulators, ...). [2]

- "Rollback simulation"
- "Yaci offering Private devnets SDKs"

## ...hydra integrations. [2]

- "hydra"
- "Hydra connection"

## ...more discoverability of the existing offering. [2]

- "I'm not using any so I don't know what the current state of ecosystem is.  It would actually be nice to have a webpage that lists \"those are the libraries for XYZ, those are a services that do ABC\". A lot of Cardano seems to be folklore and there is no one stop shop that can tell me what is already implemented or what service provides what. And if there is such place, I should already know about it so it's at least not advertised enough.",
- "ecosystem discovery"

## Unclassified

- "Maestro services on audited smart contract templates were easily available to all. It would be nice if Helios is assisted to be mature then all static websites, WordPress, web apps will easily integrate taking advantage of the most widely used inexpensive shared hosting."
