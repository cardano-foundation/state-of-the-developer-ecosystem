## ...easier blockchain data access without requiring heavy tools / services. [5]

- "Looking up the balance of an address without running a whole ass node"
- "A Blockfrost CLI can be more convenient."

## ...non-unix users, possibly even just TUI or full-blown GUI. [3]

- "Maybe TUIs would be nicer than more cli tools, especially given how complex Cardano-cli is. Cardano Tui - that’d be a good call "
