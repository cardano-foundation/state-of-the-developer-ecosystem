# Do you have any idea on how to improve the next potential Cardano Buidler Fest?

## None, don't change anything. [10]

- "no"
- "Nope"
- "No, it was great, I just hope there will be a next one."
- "Not an easy solution to this, but my biggest problem was wanting to go to overlapping talks and demos"
- "Not right now"
- "I really don't, I think a similar format would be great"
- "The bar on the first one was set pretty high so if the next edition simply follows the same path it will be equally great."
- "Honestly no. The size and format of the event were fantastic. We just need more of the same."
- "Keep it at the geek level, donâ€™t make a show.  Keep it in Toulouse. Bonjour!"
- "I think in it's scale and the content provided it was perfect. I would neither make it bigger nor change the format. We might want to do 2 of them to account for different regions [...]"

## More time and/or shared space without anything planned but developers living the moment. [6]

- "Have perhaps an extra day at the end with no agenda, just developers living the moment. Or, alternatively, have always few spaces available during the event for people to simply gather and do stuff of their own."
- "More \"hacker time\" and shared space for collaboration"
- "Longer"
- "More time for hacking. But in general the Buidler Fest was a huge success!"
- "[...] and we might want to add a hackathon event around them or a hacker house/dev residency event that culminate in the buidler fest."
- "Perhaps some semi coordinated pre or post event days to give more time to getting hands dirty in code along side other devs."


## Unclassified

- "OMG THERE WILL BE ANOTHER ONE?"
- "Find more adoption ideas. Like videogames or managing stock apps."
- "???????????"
- "Host it during warmer weather"
