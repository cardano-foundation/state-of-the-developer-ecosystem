# What do you think is the greatest asset of Cardano’s developer ecosystem?

## Aiken. [22]

- "Aiken"
- "Aiken [...]"
- "Probably Aiken"
- "Aiken"
- "aiken"
- "Aiken [...]"
- "Aiken"
- "aiken [...]"
- "Aiken."
- "Aiken"
- "Its Aiken onchain ecosystem."
- "Aiken, [...]"
- "Aiken, [...]"
- "[...] and Aiken"
- "That’s a very open ended question, but as I spend most of my time writing validators Aiken really has changed the game"
- "CF's investment in Aiken"
- "Now it is Aiken for sure"
- "Aiken. Like for real it saved cardano."
- "Right now it's Aiken"
- "Right now, Aiken, Helios and the book \"Cardano Smart Contracts\" by Lawrence Arthur Ley."
- "Aiken, [...]"
- "aiken, [...]"

## A high concentration of talented developers. [19]

- "High concentration of talent with a functional programming mindset."
- "Top Developers are unique and very detailed oriented"
- "DEVELOPERS"
- "Unfortunately a few talented people that know how to use our smart validator system and Cardano at all. This has improved over the past year with organizations like Anastasia Labs, txpipe and others but it's still rare talent on that level of knowledge."
- "ktorz. Only half joking"
- "[...] expert programmers"
- "The Developers"
- "talent"
- "[...] and developers with a passion"
- "The txpipe discord is full of devs who are very helpful with tooling problems"
- "The developers, such as ktorz"
- "Pi Lanningham"
- "TxPipe team"
- "Passionate developers"
- "[...] but also the Aiken discord channel in TxPipe. I didn't realize how important it was to have a builder focused space where people could ask questions, share achievements, and sometimes just chat / joke around. I'm also enjoying the amaru channel in PRAGMA for similar reasons and I'm hoping to find more spaces like this."
- "High caliber developer pool"
- "its developers developers developers of course :)"
- "IQ Level"
- "The talent"

## Its rigorous foundation and focus on correctness [15]

- "Cardano's greatest asset within its developer ecosystem is arguably its strong focus on formal methods and rigorous scientific research, particularly its use of Haskell as the primary language for smart contract development."
- "It just works most of the time"
- "Reproducibility and formal verification is something that only Cardano has at least an acceptable level. I've been in EVM ecosystem, and everything is clunky there, they are very far from what we have here."
- "[...] I like cardano determinism and principles."
- "Decentralised, eUTXO"
- "Scientifically sound tech, [...]"
- "Technology"
- "Reliability"
- "The research and associated core engineering."
- "Security"
- "Security"
- "Formal methods in the foundations"
- "Core Haskell based Plutus API and it's security features"
- "Culture of correctness and security over speed of deployment. [...]"
- "peer reviewed and formally verified"

## Specific tools/libraries other than Aiken (e.g. Plu-ts, Lucid-Evolution, Blaze, Mesh, db-sync, Ogmios, Kupo...) [15]

- "[...] Blaze, Yaci-Dev-Kit, Lucid-Evolution, Yaci-Store on chain indexer."
- "[...], Ogmios and Kupo."
- "cardano -node"
- "The cardano-node-emulator. It allows writing automated tests for smart-contracts written in any language. I write my contracts in aiken and can still use the cardano-node-emulator haskell library to write tests for them. It even enables benchmarking the smart contracts."
- "Mesh, Lucid-evolution [...]
- "cardano-api and Plutarch honestly. Maybe CSL for frontend as well."
- "[...] and lucid-evolution and blaze"
- "Blaze and cardano-js-sdk"
- "plu-ts"
- "Plu-ts"
- "[...] and plu-ts, both ready to use, looks good. [...]"
- "db sync"
- "DBsync"
- "Cardano dbsynch"
- Amazing open source tools, from demeter to ogmios,kupo, pycardano, opshin to free tier levels of access to indexers like blockfrost ,koios and demeter."

## Its tooling diversity and open source collaboration. [11]

- "Community cross pollination I see with with different language teams. Blink labs building a Go Node out while working with Amaru and vice versa. Let em cook!"
- "Its diversity, across many language ecosystem and developers from all horizons."
- "The community's willingness to jump in and provide opensource tools where IOG completely dropped the ball on developer experience."
- "The cooperation in the space is admirable and other people are always ready to help"
- "The variety of tools. Especially in smart contracts, that I have multiple options to choose from."
- "Organic growth of solutions, lots of open source."
- "Open Source ecosystem"
- "the strength and size of the open source community."
- "Vibrant community, especially the part that people can manage difficult discussion. Open collaboration to work on same piece of open source software"
- "Diverse options of domain specific languages for people to use for building instead of strictly Haskell"
- "The tenacity and willingness of the community to build what is lacking"

## Its people & community. [10]

- "Community"
- "Genuine people"
- "Diversity and passion"
- "The community"
- "community"
- "Tenacity"
- "the community [...]
- "[...] developer support from other people, can just hop in discord and ask"
- "The amazing diversity of different and multi-talented individuals all doing their part to improve in various languages and environments."
- "The community is available for questions."

## Good education material such as Gimbalabs PBL or CF's Academy [6]

- "Entry level education - gimbalabs ppbl, CF's blockchain course, plutus pioneers"
- "The developer survey"
- "knowledge"
- "[...], professors, [...]"
- "[...], Developer Portal"
- "Docs"

## Unclassified

- "-"
- "---------------"
- "."
- "???????????"
- "\"This question is required\"."
- "A universal, multi-platform language some big players are starting to use, but you probably have not yet because funding and marketing makes tooling popular on Cardano, not features, values  and capabilities."

- "Don't know enough to answer."
- "Go to bed now so I'll be there in about the election and Spanish flu  me ha I me know when you get here please"
