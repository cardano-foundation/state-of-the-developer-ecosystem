For example, just governance contract with offchain, just staking contract (with always_true spending &/ governance validator) with offchain, etc. No fancy integration utilizing various concepts.",

From my talks with other technical guys nobody really knows what was changed with Chang (i.e. do scripts need to be registered now to DRep to get rewards, when do you need to upgrade to V3, etc.).
