# What is your most awaited feature when it comes to Cardano’s smart contracts?

## PlutusV3 (BLS, Zero-Knowledge...) (16)

- More capabilities and Zero Knowledge
- PlutusV3 because of Blake2b224 hash, bitwise builtins, and BLS primitives
- schnorr validation, bls essentials, primitives for validating prime-field operations
- Assets (coins) as first class values (Asset oriented programming). Onchain developer royalties. Onchain access to certain L1 features like VRF, account based systems (like Cardano’s staking system), BLS curves for ZKP.
- pairing curves (https://eprint.iacr.org/2015/072.pdf)
- BLS elliptic curve operations
- rollups and zk primitives
- zk
- BLS12-381
- BLS
- Bitwise primitives and modular exponential builtin functions
- BLS primitives and Bit - wise operations
- Plutus v3
- zkp
- Plutus V3, ZK primitives, UPLC Constr/Case, merging of Plutus Data into UPLC, EC point operations primitives, bitwise operations primitives
- BLS builtins

## Maturity of emerging solutions (e.g. Aiken, Helios, ...) (14)

- Production ready languages (aiken, opshin) + remix like code editor with build and deploy smart contract functionality
- Naumachia
- better support for interoperability between different smart contracts
- Property based testing in Aiken
- Aiken mainnet relase
- Marlowe?  Aiken? I need better tooling for a guy who hasn't been a developer since... before blockchain
- Improved support for emerging languages
- Aiken Improvments
- Investment into better developer-friendly languages and compilation to untyped Plutus core support for popular languages like Typescript and Go
- depreciation of plutustx
- Aiken beta
- Better Aiken / Helios ecosystem
- An aiken release with an audit (or audits) that can be relied upon for serious Cardano projects.
- Being able to code them in a simpler language

## More educational material / Easier on-boarding (10)

- Just more educational material
- Open-sourcing a lot of them
- Easier to use dev tools and learning resources
- Less steep learning curves.
- Diverse selection of contracts to utilize as a base toolkit/library
- Better accessibility
- Easy examples on a hub like https://www.marlowehub.io.
- I'm too ignorant to answer this question.  Is better learning materials a feature?
- Great documentation
- Overall better polish and documentation

## Better off-chain interoperability (7)

- Off chain code generation from blueprint for aiken
- More off chain dsl, preferably not in js/ts
- Typescript support
- Integration in existing off chain processes
- better support for interoperability between different smart contracts
- JavaScript or TypeScript SDK to generate Cardano's smart contracts
- Off-chain check of tx

## Input endorsers & scalability (7)

- Tiered fees, input endorsers for improved scalability
- Input endorsers
- Input Endorsers
- Input Endordser
- scalabilty
- Higher throughput
- Contention so

## Usability & Accessibility (7)

- Being able to develop on a Windows computer
- a smart contract IDE
- Just an overall better development toolset and ecosystem
- Plutus Debugger
- Easy deployment playground as remix web page
- better tooling
- Better tooling

## Increased execution limits and/or smaller execution costs (7)

- Raised execution units limits
- Higher limits for tx size and ex units.
- Reduction in txn costs and standardised on stable coins rather than Ada, maybe something like hydra without the heads making it more accessible
- bigger tx block size
- less cost
- script size reduced
- Making it cheaper to execute

## Better abstractions to work with EUTxO (5)

- Being able to build more complex expression for the smart contracts and also hopefully someday we can abstract everything much better to the point where the average developer can just do LockAsset() Swap() RedeemAsset()
- Abstractions on top of the EUTXO model to facilitate creating validators.
- Transaction-level validation without using compositional hacks
- Composability, some method to avoid batching
- Plug and play smart contract suites for off-chain businesses of all types

## Hydra (5)

- Hydra
- Hydra
- Documentation with good everyday life on-/off chain examples with Hydra
- Hydra
- Hydra

## On-chain randomness (2)

- Time and randomness would both be nice.
- On chain random number generation

## Identity (2)

- More integration and development with Atala Prism in the ecosystem.
- Native Capability for layer2 or sidechain data networks and access control networks like SSI

## Optional datum (2)

- Spending UTXOs that do not have a datum.
- (Optional Datum) and (optional redeemer) so that wallets can directly pay to contract address without worrying  about the datum. Datum and redeemer is optional in ledger but it is the plutus that is demanding them.

## Plutus-Tx Improvements (2)

- Faster and smaller smart contracts with future PlutusTx updates
- PlutusTx optimisation and better tooling

## Voltaire (2)

- Voltaire
- Governance and Dapps

## Unclassified

- onchain encryption primitives
- Probably on chain liabilities, I believe it will bring a whole new paradigm to how we interact with smart contracts
- All good for now
- None
- All of them!
- I dont really have one, although better management of time would be good, at the minute it is very limited
- I have not specific feature.
- Domain/app specific chain indexers
- I'm early in my learning journey, but I understand the PAB delays caused a lot of bemusement.
- Midnight
- Cardano is a smart contract-building platform that focuses on decentralization and scalabilit. The use of Cardano for developing smart contracts offers  Safer and more reliable transactions.
- Looking forward to any feature that could help small SPOs grow and decentralization, multidelegation, etc. Also concerned about security/auditing to prevent any fail and/or hack.
- Financial support to afford learning new languages
- none
- move 100% to rust
- need some global state
- Purus
- not given it enough creative thought; requiring basics
- TANX $WAN #Wanchain
- Do not care as long as catalyst is broken
- Storage
- Parameterized validator compilation on the fly
- Assets (coins) as first class citizens (AoP). Onchain developer royalties.
- Cryptography builtins
- Reference Inputs
- collateral changes
- Greater and better application to use cases
- Efficient Associative Maps
- Nothing at the moment
- First make existing delivers the promises
- Many are excited about the development of decentralized applications on the Cardano blockchain. Smart contracts will enable the creation of a wide range of DApps, including DeFi (Decentralized Finance) applications, NFT platforms, and more.
- TBH I am close to giving up on Cardano as it feels it hasn't become what it should have and will most likely die
- Industry
- Validators ran on input reference
- Concurrency
- VRF
- Ported on icp
- AI functions working with a lib (aiken as example), if we can have a code skeleton by inserting how a transaction and rules should work and get back an answer could be easier to understand how it works and what path we could go
- Automatic trading
- I haven't done any recently. But the best features are software IDEs and tools, which were lacking last time I looked at plutus pioneer program in iteration 2
- The most awaited was reference scripts feature
- Typscript/JavaScript dev. Break down of the main node components and how they interact, for example how to submit a transaction to my node, query on-chain data using a backend db.
- Reference inputs and reference scripts
- the very best
- Open-source culture to become the community norm
- oracle
- Alonzo hard fork
- I'm happy with the current feature set of Cardano smart contracts
- Maybe better or cheaper oracles
- chaining
- Primitives to support bridging and interoperability
- Finalised baseline design & spec
- Multi validators. Being able to have self starting contracts that do not depend on a trusted set up via a token being placed in the utxo.
