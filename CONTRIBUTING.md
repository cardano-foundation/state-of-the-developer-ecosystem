# Contributing 

Welcome to the Cardano state of the developer ecosystem repository. In here, we'll host the data we collect each year from developers who took the survey, as well as the code for rendering and analyzing it. There are many ways you can contribute to the effort!

### Suggesting new filters

Some questions have pre-defined filters to allow seeing potential correlations with other questions. If there's new filters you'd like to see, come forth through [Github discussions][New filter] and tell us about it! 

### Suggesting new questions

We aim for conducting the survey every year to see the evolution of the ecosystem throughout time. However, the general context may change and as the time pass, new problematic will emerge. If you think of such a problematic which would deserve special attention for the next edition, make a poll on [Github discussions][New question] and see what the community thinks about the idea! 

## Coding 

Every edition is stored in a dedicated folder (e.g. `2022`) and have specific instructions when it comes to building. Feel free to read the instructions if the keyboard is itching and feel like contributing to the source.
